        <h3>We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments.<br> We only work on a few products and we strive to make them <br> great.</h3>
        <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work <br> their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that <br> are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t <br> always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
        <img src="./asset/asset1.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally <br> passionate about improving who we are.</h4>
        <p>We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally and professionally,<br> and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>
        <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new <br>knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-<br>organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production <br>techniques and best practices.</p>

        <p>If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with <br>relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive  <br>health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office  <br>hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the  <br>year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
